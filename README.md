ERP is a web portal in which we can keep track of all the products available and orders to be delivered and at the same time can add, delete and edit the products and can change the status of the orders.

It consist of:
1) Dashboard, where the number of products available and orders are accessible.
2) Products, where we can add, delete and edit the products
3) Orders, where we can edit the status of orders(Delivered, In Process and Failed).
4) Calendar, that displays orders on their expected delivery dates and the details of orders on clicking an event.
